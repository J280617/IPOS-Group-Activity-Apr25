# IPOS-Group-Activity-Apr25

Create a repository on GitHub (everybody should use a different repository name for their repository) 
Commit code to the repository and set up tests with GitHub Actions
Everybody will find a bug in their repository and open an issue in their repository 
Then each one will clone the repo of one of their exercise partners, fix the bug, and open a pull request (GitHub)
Everybody then merges their co-workerâ€™s change
